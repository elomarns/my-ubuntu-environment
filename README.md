# My Ubuntu Environment

My goal with this repository is to store as much of my Ubuntu environment as possible, so I can easily restore it in a fresh Ubuntu install with a single command.

This was inspired by [Omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub), but I don't intend it to be as general or configurable. What I have here are my personal preferences, and the install script is designed to apply them with the minimum amount of interaction. So I don't really think this is going to be very useful to anyone but me.

## Install

Just run the command below on a freshly installed Ubuntu:

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elomarns/my-ubuntu-environment/main/boot.sh | bash
```
